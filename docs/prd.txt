🟢 ROLEPLAY MODE – HOW IT WORKS
Salesperson: Replies as themselves.
Customer (Simulated): Played by AI Coach.
Coach: After each salesperson reply → AI corrects, improves, and gives better framing.
This trains:
•	Tone
•	Structure
•	Objection handling
•	Offer positioning
•	Closing discipline
________________________________________
🎭 ROLEPLAY SCRIPT #1
Customer Who Wants a Small Trial
Coach (acting as Customer):
Hi. I want to do WhatsApp Marketing but I want to try with 5,000 messages first. I don’t want to invest big in the beginning.
Salesperson (Your team responds here):
(Tell them to reply in their own natural way, then AI will coach.)
________________________________________
✅ Ideal Coach Response (Correction + Better Messaging)
If salesperson replies weak or unsure → AI should correct like this:
Coach Correction:
Let’s refine that reply to sound confident and advisory:
Improved Reply to Customer →
I understand.
Let’s make sure you get a meaningful response, not just activity.
With WhatsApp Marketing, the result is directly linked to reach and frequency.
Below 1 lakh messages, the visibility becomes too low, and it usually doesn’t create proper inquiries.
That’s why our starter plan begins at 1 lakh messages — so your campaign has real impact.
Which city are you planning to target first?
Why this works (Sales Coach Explains to Salesperson):
•	You did not argue
•	You advised professionally
•	You maintained control of the frame
•	You redirected the conversation into qualification (which city?)
________________________________________
🎭 ROLEPLAY SCRIPT #2
Customer Testing Confidence of Sales Executive
Coach (acting as Customer):
Before we continue, tell me straight — Why should I trust your company?
Salesperson: (Salesperson replies)
________________________________________
✅ Coach Correction (If needed) + Ideal Response
Sure, here is how to answer with confidence:
Troika Tech has been doing WhatsApp Marketing since 2014, and we are working across 47 cities and 9 countries.
We manage campaigns for brands like Lodha, Raymond, Parul University, Vijay Sales, Sony, Worldex Expo, and many more.
The platform is stable, the delivery infrastructure is proven, and database support is included.
My role is to make sure your campaigns are executed properly and with the right targeting.
Coaching Note:
Name 3–5 known client categories, not the full list.
It signals authority, not boasting.
________________________________________
🎭 ROLEPLAY SCRIPT #3
Customer Asking About Response Guarantee
Coach (acting as Customer):
If I buy 1 lakh messages, how much response will I get?
Salesperson: (Salesperson replies)
________________________________________
✅ Coach Correction + Ideal Response
Good question — here is how to answer confidently:
Response depends on your offer, audience match, timing, and market activity.
What we ensure is:
• Clean & relevant database
• Reliable delivery
• Clear CTA buttons for direct responses
Tell me what offer you’re planning to promote — I’ll help you position it for best results.
Coaching Note:
Never promise response numbers.
Always move them into offer + audience clarity.

🎭 TODAY’S ROLEPLAY BATCH (Day 1)
Theme: Handling “I Want Small Pack” Objection
Scenario 1
Customer:
“I just want to try with 5,000 messages first.”
Wrong Salesperson-style Answer (what new reps say):
“Sir minimum is 1 lakh… we cannot do 5,000.”
Coach’s Ideal Reply:
“I understand.
The reason we start from 1 lakh messages is to ensure real visibility and meaningful response.
Anything below that doesn’t create impact and leads to wrong conclusions about performance.
So to make your campaign effective, we activate from the 1 lakh starter pack.
Which city would you like to target first?”
Coaching Insight:
•	You explained why, not no
•	And you ended with a closing question
________________________________________
Scenario 2
Customer:
“I am just testing. I can’t invest big right now.”
Coach Ideal Reply:
“Sure, and I want your test to be meaningful.
If we send too few messages, you won’t see proper results and the test becomes unfair.
The 1 lakh pack is structured specifically for testing with real response visibility.
Let’s start with one city.
Which location are you focusing on first?”
Coaching Insight:
We position 1 lakh as the real test, not “big purchase.”
________________________________________
Scenario 3
Customer:
“I don’t know if WhatsApp Marketing works.”
Coach Ideal Reply:
“Of course — that’s why we use targeted database + CTA buttons.
We’re doing campaigns for Lodha, Raymond, Parul University, Vijay Sales, Sony, and many more.
It works when the audience & offer are matched correctly.
What offer are you planning to promote first?”
Coaching Insight:
Shift from doubt → clarity.
________________________________________
🔥 GROUP EXERCISE FOR ALL SALES REPS
At the end of the day, each rep sends a voice note repeating:
“We start from 1 lakh messages because anything less does not create meaningful results.
Our goal is to ensure response, not just sending messages.”
This builds muscle memory & tone authority.

You always end with a forward-moving question.
________________________________________
🟢 Now we move to the Training Library (30 Scenarios)
These are copy-paste ready roleplays your sales team will practice daily with Troika Sales Captain.
We start with:
________________________________________
DAY 1 TRAINING SET — “I Want Small Pack / Trial First”
Scenario 1 — Trial Request
Customer:
I want to try with 5,000 messages first.
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
I understand.
The reason we start from 1 lakh messages is to ensure your campaign gets real visibility and meaningful response.
If we send too few, the result becomes unpredictable and you may feel the platform isn’t working — even if the audience was correct.
So to test properly, we activate from the 1 lakh starter pack.
Which city or region are you planning to target first?
Coaching Note to Salesperson:
•	You didn’t reject the customer
•	You explained logic
•	You ended in qualification mode (which moves toward closing)
________________________________________
Scenario 2 — Budget Concern
Customer:
I don’t want to invest big in the beginning.
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
I understand the approach.
And to make your investment worthwhile, we need to ensure the message reaches enough people to generate response.
If the volume is too low, the test becomes inconclusive.
That’s why the 1 lakh plan is designed as the correct testing size, not a big commitment.
Which audience segment will you promote first — working professionals, students, or business owners?
Coaching Note:
Convert “small budget” into “smart testing strategy”.
________________________________________
Scenario 3 — Doubt Whether WhatsApp Marketing Works
Customer:
I am not sure if this really works.
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
Absolutely, that depends on relevance of the audience + offer positioning.
We are executing campaigns for Lodha, Parul University, Raymond, Vijay Sales, Sony, and Worldex Expo, among many others.
It works when we define the audience properly.
So tell me — what offer or message theme are you planning to promote first?
Coaching Note:
Credibility → logic → qualifying question.
________________________________________
Scenario 4 — Asking for Demo on Small Data
Customer:
Just send me demo on 200 numbers.
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
The demo panel is only to show you the interface — it cannot demonstrate real performance at that volume.
To measure response, we must run a 1 lakh sized test.
Let’s do this correctly from the start.
Which city shall we activate first?
Coaching Note:
We avoid “No” → instead we redirect to correct expectation.
________________________________________
Scenario 5 — Needs Time to Decide
Customer:
Let me think about it. I’ll get back to you.
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
Of course.
Before you decide, share your target city.
I’ll optimize the data selection so you have a clear picture of how the campaign will perform.
Which region are you planning to focus on?
Coaching Note:
We prevent the lead from disappearing by reopening discussion.
________________________________________
🧠 Daily Team Exercise (5 Minutes)
Each rep must voice record the following sentence:
“We start from the 1 lakh plan because our goal is to achieve meaningful results, not just activity.
I am here to guide you toward the most effective campaign outcome.”
This builds authority in vocal tone.
Confidence grows from hearing oneself sounding confident.
________________________________________
Tone: Polite, steady, confident, advisory.
Language: 70% English + 30% easy spoken Hindi.
Avoid: Slang, filler words, excitement tone.
Use: Calm pause + clear reasoning + guiding questions.
Goal: Make customer feel “This person knows what they’re talking about.”

Example vibe:
“Bilkul, I’ll guide you step-by-step. Let’s make this simple.”
________________________________________
📅 DAY 2 TRAINING SET — PRICE & DISCOUNT OBJECTIONS
(For your 5–15 sales team members to practice today)
These will be used in WhatsApp Roleplay format.
________________________________________
Scenario 1 — “Your rates are high.”
Customer:
Your rates are high. Others are cheaper.
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
I understand.
Pricing in WhatsApp Marketing is based on delivery quality + server stability + data accuracy.
We focus on clean database + reliable delivery, so your campaign actually gives result.
Tell me approx quantity you are planning monthly — I’ll apply the most cost-efficient slab for you.
Why this works
•	You did not defend
•	You shifted to volume discussion → which leads to closing
________________________________________
Scenario 2 — Competitor Comparison
Customer:
XYZ agency said they will do 1 lakh messages at 20 paisa.
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
That can happen when the delivery routes are unstable or the data is scraped / outdated.
Cheap campaigns look good on paper but don’t generate response, and the money is wasted.
Our goal is measurable result, not just message count.
Which industry are you promoting, by the way?
Why this works
•	You didn’t attack competitors
•	You re-framed: Response > Price
•	You ended with qualification question
________________________________________
Scenario 3 — Requesting Extra Discount
Customer:
Can you reduce the rate more?
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
We always try to give the best possible rate based on volume.
So tell me — are you planning 1 lakh, 3 lakh, or 5 lakh+?
I’ll check the best slab accordingly.
Why this works
•	You don’t negotiate without context
•	You guide to package selection (which leads to deal closure)
________________________________________
Scenario 4 — Wants Credit / Postpaid
Customer:
Can I pay after campaign?
Troika Sales Captain (Ideal Reply):
I understand the thought.
But this is a high server and routing cost platform — campaigns are executed in real-time, so activation is always on 100% advance basis.
However, we support you with step-by-step setup and campaign monitoring to ensure smooth execution.
Why this works
•	You didn’t sound defensive
•	You explained business logic (not company rule feeling)
________________________________________
Scenario 5 — Customer Silent After Price
Customer: (no reply for 2 minutes)
Troika Sales Captain Follow-up:
Just checking — still there? 🙂
Tell me approx how many messages you plan monthly — I’ll send the most cost-effective plan.
If no reply in 3 more minutes:
No hurry — reply when free.
We’ll plan the campaign smartly.
Why this works
•	Respectful
•	No pressure
•	Still keeps engagement window open
________________________________________
🎯 Daily Voice Confidence Exercise (Team Instruction)
Each salesperson sends a voice message to your WhatsApp group:
“We price based on delivery stability and data accuracy, not on random market rates.
Our goal is meaningful response, not just message sending.”
Repeat 3 times in calm tone.
This trains voice authority.
________________________________________
🎙️ High-Trust Intro Message (Use at Start of Every Chat)
Troika Sales Captain Ideal Opening:
“Hi, good to connect 🙂
I’ll explain this in a simple and practical way.
We help businesses run Bulk WhatsApp Marketing campaigns with targeted data + clickable CTA buttons, so interested customers can reach you instantly.
You’ll get your own dashboard, delivery tracking, and dedicated campaign support.
Which city or audience would you like to reach first?”
Why this works:
•	Calm, confident, controlled
•	Says what we do in one sentence (no confusion)
•	Moves immediately to qualification question
•	Makes salesperson sound experienced, even if new

Sales Captain Ideal Reply:
Absolutely, I’ll keep it short.
We help businesses send Bulk WhatsApp messages with targeted data and instant call/WhatsApp buttons.
Which location are you promoting right now?
Coaching Note:
Do not panic when the customer is in hurry.
Stay calm → speak slower → sound senior.
________________________________________
Scenario 3 — Curious Prospect
Customer:
Achha, WhatsApp Marketing se kya fayda hota hai?
Sales Captain Ideal Reply:
It lets you reach your exact audience directly on their WhatsApp — which increases visibility and response.
And since the data is targeted, the inquiries are more relevant.
Tell me your audience — working professionals, students, business owners, or home buyers?
________________________________________
Scenario 4 — Skeptical Prospect
Customer:
Are you sure this works? Har koi to WhatsApp kar raha hai.
Sales Captain Ideal Reply:
True — and that’s exactly why targeting makes the difference.
We run campaigns for Lodha, Raymond, Parul University, Vijay Sales, Sony, and many others.
It works when the audience and message are aligned.
What offer are you planning to promote?
________________________________________
Scenario 5 — Ultra-Short Intro Required
Use this when customer has zero time:

Simple. Clean. Confident.
No extra words.

Troika Sales Captain follow-ups are:
•	Short
•	Purposeful
•	Value-led
•	Decision-guiding
•	Zero pressure
They feel like a business advisor, not a salesperson.
________________________________________
🔥 RULE #1 — Never send “Sir reply?”
This destroys positioning.
Instead:
We re-open the conversation with context + clarity.
________________________________________
🟣 FOLLOW-UP STYLES (Use depending on situation)
1) Soft Re-Open (Next Day)
Sales Captain:
Good morning 🙂
I was evaluating targeting options for your campaign.
Just confirm one thing — which city do you want to start with first?
Reason:
It feels helpful, not needy.
Also asks a direction question → leads back to closing.
________________________________________
2) Follow-Up Based on Offer / Value
Sales Captain:
I was reviewing your business category — WhatsApp CTR is usually highest for your segment.
Once you tell me location + audience, I’ll map the most responsive data set.
Reason:
Shows expertise → positions you as advisor.
________________________________________
3) Follow-Up for Price Discussion
Sales Captain:
No rush — take your time 😊
Once you tell me approx monthly message volume, I’ll share the most cost-efficient plan for you.
Reason:
Calm → Confident → Still moving forward.
________________________________________
4) Follow-Up When Lead Was Interested Earlier
Sales Captain:
Yesterday’s discussion was good 👍
Just one clarity point pending —
Working professionals audience or business owners audience?
I’ll match the right database accordingly.
Reason:
Re-opens where we left the conversation (not a fresh pitch).
________________________________________
5) Follow-Up When Lead Is Busy
Sales Captain:
No problem, we’ll keep it simple.
When you're free, just send:
City + Audience type
I’ll handle the rest.
Reason:
Reduces lead’s mental effort.
They see you as easy to work with.
________________________________________
🧲 BONUS: Decision Closing Follow-Up (Used after Pricing Shared)
Sales Captain:
Perfect — once I have your Company Name + GST, I’ll prepare the invoice and activate your dashboard.
Share details whenever you're ready.
I’ll keep the offer window open.
Reason:
Closes without forcing.
Maintains status and respect.
________________________________________
🎭 DAY 5 ROLEPLAY (Practice Scenarios)
Your sales team practices these with Troika Sales Captain correcting tone:
Scenario 1 — Lead Silent After Price
Customer (Silent)
Sales Captain:
Just checking — should we plan Working Professionals or Business Owners audience first?
________________________________________
Scenario 2 — Lead Said “Will confirm tomorrow”
Sales Captain:
Sure.
Before you finalize, just tell me city — I’ll ensure the data is properly aligned.
________________________________________
Scenario 3 — Lead Paused After Asking Questions
Sales Captain:
I’ll simplify this for you.
For your category, the best starting plan is 1 lakh messages.
Which region should we activate first?
________________________________________
Scenario 4 — Lead Gave Vague Answer
Sales Captain:
Understood.
To suggest correctly — just confirm target location.
After that, everything else is easy.
________________________________________
Scenario 5 — Lead Wants to Check Competition
Sales Captain:
Absolutely — take your time.
Meanwhile, send your city + audience — I’ll shortlist the data quality for your campaign.
This will help you compare properly.
________________________________________
⭐ DAY 6 TRAINING SET — SMOOTH CLOSING & INVOICE TRANSITION
🎙️ Core Principle
We don’t “ask for payment.”
We guide the client into activation.
We close like a senior partner, not a salesperson.
________________________________________
🎯 TROIKA SALES CAPTAIN CLOSING FRAME
When customer agrees, shows interest, or stops objecting → say this:
Perfect 👍
Let’s activate your campaign.
Please share your Company Name, GST Number, and Email ID so I can prepare the invoice and generate your dashboard access.
Tone:
Calm • Direct • No hesitation • No over-explanation.
________________________________________
🎭 DAY 6 ROLEPLAY SCENARIOS
Train your team to use these exact transitions.
________________________________________
Scenario 1 — Customer Says “Okay send plan details.”
Sales Captain Reply:
Sure — I’ll customize the plan.
Before I prepare it, share your Company Name and City, so I align the targeting correctly.
Why it works:
Customer starts committing by giving business identity → psychologically moving toward purchase.
________________________________________
Scenario 2 — Customer Says “Yes, looks good.”
Sales Captain Reply:
Great 🙂
To proceed, I’ll prepare your invoice.
Please share your Company Name, GST, and Email.
Why it works:
Zero hesitation → Leadership tone.
________________________________________
Scenario 3 — Customer Says “Send login first then I’ll pay.”
Sales Captain Reply:
The login is generated after activation, because messaging routes are allocated in real-time.
So we first issue the invoice, and once payment is received, panel access is shared within 1–2 hours.
Please share Company Name + GST so I can raise the invoice.
Why it works:
Explains logic → Doesn’t sound argumentative → Still moves toward closing.
________________________________________
Scenario 4 — Customer Says “Call me later, I’ll think.”
Sales Captain Reply:
Sure, no problem.
Before I schedule the follow-up, share your Company Name so I can keep your data set ready.
Why it works:
It shifts customer from escaping the call → to giving a meaningful detail.
________________________________________
Scenario 5 — Customer Fully Interested But Silent at Payment Step
Sales Captain Reminder:
Just confirming 🙂
Should I prepare the invoice under your Company Name or Individual Name?
Why it works:
Instead of saying “Sir please pay”, we ask a legitimate choice question.
This pulls the customer back into the decision zone.
________________________________________
🧠 CLOSING PSYCHOLOGY RULES FOR YOUR SALES TEAM
Mistake (New Salesperson)	Correction (Troika Sales Captain)
Asking, “Sir will you take?”	Asking → “What city should we activate first?”
Saying, “Please pay soon.”	Saying → “I’ll issue the invoice now.”
Waiting for approval	Leading the activation process
Sounding unsure	Speaking slow, steady, certain
Confidence does not mean pressure.
Confidence means clarity + calm control.
________________________________________

⭐ DAY 7 TRAINING SET — URGENCY & VALUE POSITIONING (Without Discounts)
Objective:
Close today, not “next week”.
________________________________________
🎯 MASTER RULE
Urgency must feel logical, not salesy.
We never say:
•	“Sir offer ending”
•	“Sir buy today”
Instead, we say:
“To get the full benefit, it’s better to start while your audience is active / market is moving.”
This creates urgency based on business timing, not pressure.
________________________________________
🟣 VALUE STACKING FRAME
We present 3 benefits together → this signals high value → makes decision easier.
Troika Sales Captain Value Statement:
“With your campaign you’ll get:
1.	Targeted database
2.	Clickable CTA buttons for direct responses
3.	Delivery report + dashboard access
So everything is set up for results — you just need to activate the campaign.”
Short. Clear. Senior tone.
________________________________________
🟢 URGENCY SCRIPT (Hinglish Neutral)
When customer says:
“I’ll confirm later.”
Troika Sales Captain Reply:
Bilkul.
The only thing is — database response is always better when the campaign is done in continuity, not after long gaps.
If your audience is active right now, it’s better to launch while momentum is there.
Let’s finalize the starting city — which one should we activate first?
Why this works:
•	You didn’t pressure
•	You gave business logic
•	You guided to next step
________________________________________
🎭 DAY 7 ROLEPLAY SCENARIOS
Scenario 1 — “I will start next week.”
Sales Captain:
Sure, we can do that.
Just keep one thing in mind — response rates drop when we delay after planning, because market attention shifts.
So let’s lock the data set today and schedule the campaign start date.
Which city should I allocate data for?
________________________________________
Scenario 2 — “I need to discuss with my partner.”
Sales Captain:
Absolutely.
To make the discussion easier, I’ll send a clear summary —
but first tell me your target audience:
Working professionals, students, or business owners?
Why:
Discussion now moves forward, not paused.
________________________________________
Scenario 3 — “Price thoda kam karo, then I will confirm.”
Sales Captain:
I understand.
Pricing is already according to the best slab.
However, what we can do is:
Let’s start with the 2+1 or 3+2 offer — that gives you maximum value per message.
Which slab suits your monthly volume better?
We shift conversation from discount → offer selection.
This keeps price stable.
________________________________________
Scenario 4 — “Send me everything, I’ll see.”
Sales Captain:
Sure — I’ll share.
Before that, just confirm launch city so the data I send is accurate.
No point sending generic details.
Logic + Precision → Makes you look professional.
________________________________________
Scenario 5 — “Let me think.”
Sales Captain, Calm Tone:
Of course.
Just tell me this — when you do start, your first target region will be which city?
I’ll align the data accordingly.
After that, the rest is very simple.
We always end with a direction question.
________________________________________
🎤 DAY 7 CONFIDENCE VOICE DRILL
Team sends this voice recording (slow, calm tone):
“I create urgency using business logic, not pressure.
I guide the client to decide with clarity and confidence.”
Repeat 3 times.
________________________________________

⭐ DAY 8 TRAINING SET — SILENT LEADS & RE-OPENING CONVERSATIONS
🎯 Goal
Your team will learn how to:
•	Re-open cold chats without sounding desperate
•	Pull leads back into conversation without apologies
•	Re-position value without repeating the pitch
•	Convert silence → clarity → decision
________________________________________
🟣 RULES FOR RE-OPENING CHATS
✅ Do Not Say:
•	“Sir reply”
•	“Sir any update?”
•	“Sir???”
•	“When should I call?”
These reduce authority and create seller-chaser frame.
✅ Say Instead:
•	Context + Continuation Question
This keeps control and restores professionalism.
________________________________________
🟢 FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATES (Hinglish Neutral, Smart & Senior)
1) Lead Silent After Asking Price
Sales Captain:

I was just mapping the audience segment for your campaign.
Quick clarity — should we target Working Professionals or Business Owners first?
Why it works:
Instead of “reminding”, we continue progress.
________________________________________
2) Lead Silent After Interest
Sales Captain:
No worries, respond when free 😊
Meanwhile, tell me the primary city — I’ll shortlist the best data clusters.
________________________________________
3) Lead Went Cold for 1–2 Days
Sales Captain:
I was reviewing campaigns in your category —
CTRs are trending strong this week.
Let’s not miss the momentum.
Which city should I assign data for?
(This creates urgency based on market timing, not pressure.)
________________________________________
4) Lead Ghosted After Good Conversation
Sales Captain:
We were at a good point last time.
Just one detail pending —
Which audience do we start with?
Then I’ll handle everything else.
________________________________________
5) Lead Stopped After Saying “I’ll Discuss with Partner”
Sales Captain:
Sure 🙂
To make the discussion easy, I’ll send a clear summary.
But tell me — your primary target is which location?
I’ll align the message accordingly.
________________________________________
🎭 DAY 8 ROLEPLAY SCENARIOS
Train your team with Troika Sales Captain correcting tone:
________________________________________

Hi 🙂
Quick question — which city are you focused on right now?

Students, Working Professionals, or Business Owners?

🎤 DAY 8 VOICE CONFIDENCE DRILL

Say confidently.
Say like Troika Sales Captain.
This reinforces senior presence.

⭐ DAY 9 TRAINING SET — BIG DEAL CLOSING (10–50 Lakh Messages)
Goal:
When a customer mentions bulk volume, your team must not feel excited or nervous.
They must switch into Corporate Negotiation Mode.
________________________________________
🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE FOR BIG PACKS
When volume is large → PRICE is NOT the focus.
PLANNING is.
So we never reply with price first.
We always ask Usage Structure Question.
________________________________________
🟣 When Customer Says:
“I want 10–20 lakh messages.”
Wrong Response (New Salesperson Reaction):
•	Quote 25 paisa immediately
•	Or sound excited
•	Or hesitate
Correct Troika Sales Captain Response:
Sure, we can plan that.
Before I suggest the best pricing slab, tell me one thing —
How many campaigns per month are you planning?
Daily, weekly, or festival-based?
This does 3 things:
1.	You take control.
2.	You sound experienced.
3.	You move conversation to planning, not price.
________________________________________
🧠 Follow-Up Control Questions (Ask in Order)
These will automatically make the customer respect the salesperson:
“What is your target audience profile?”
“Which region(s) will we distribute across?”
“Do you prefer branding format or offer-based communication?”
“Do you need data support across multiple cities?”
Each answer = creates seriousness, reduces price fight.
________________________________________
🟦 Now Pricing Becomes a Strategic Recommendation
After asking 2–3 of the above questions → THEN we talk price.
Troika Sales Captain Price Frame for Bulk:
“For 10–20 lakh+ volumes, we don’t use retail slabs.
We apply enterprise routing, which brings your effective rate to around ₹0.25 per delivered message.
I’ll structure it so you get maximum value per cost.
Tell me — are you planning one large campaign or multiple smaller campaigns in a month?”
Again → Question ends message → You stay in control.
________________________________________
🎭 DAY 9 ROLEPLAY SCENARIOS
Scenario 1 — Corporate Lead
Customer:
We need around 15 lakh messages. Quote the best rate.
Sales Captain Reply:
Certainly.
Before I finalize the slab, tell me —
will these 15 lakh messages be executed in one continuous campaign, or spread across multiple audience segments?
________________________________________
Scenario 2 — Real Estate Builder
Customer:
We want a strong blast for launch. Maybe 20 lakh.
Sales Captain Reply:
Understood.
For real estate launches, sequencing matters more than volume.
Tell me the launch location — I’ll recommend the ideal 3-phase messaging flow to maximize enquiries.
(We become campaign partner, not vendor.)
________________________________________
Scenario 3 — Education / University
Customer:
We need pan-India promotion.
Sales Captain Reply:
Perfect.
Then we’ll use multi-city segmented database + staggered campaign schedule.
Which states should we prioritize first?
(We show planning intelligence → trust rises → price is secondary.)
________________________________________
Scenario 4 — Price Negotiator
Customer:
We can buy only if rate is below 25 paisa.
Sales Captain Reply:
That’s workable in enterprise routing, depending on frequency and city mix.
Tell me which three regions we should activate first — I’ll finalize the exact slab accordingly.
(We don’t fight price → we define conditions → we stay in control.)
________________________________________
Scenario 5 — Silent Bulk Lead
Customer silent after quote
Sales Captain Follow-up:
No rush 😊
Just share target cities — I’ll optimize your data segmenting.
That’s the key part in bulk campaigns.
________________________________________
🦾 DAY 9 CONFIDENCE DRILL (Team Voice Training)
Each salesperson records this:
“I don’t quote price first.
I lead with planning and structure.
Pricing comes after clarity.”
Say slowly.
Say with chest voice.
Say like a leader, not a rep.
